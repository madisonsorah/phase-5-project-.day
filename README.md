# phase-5-project-pixelpad
Pixelpad is an approachable, thoughtfully designed, bullet journal-style web application. When an author creates an account, they can choose from one of six template themes or customize their own theme for daily habit tracking. Each journal entry is saved to an authorâ€™s profile for their reference, but is completely private and can only be viewed by them. As an incentive to habit track each day, depending on how many days an author submits an entry in a row, they can unlock new features for customizing or decorating their journal (new stickers, backgrounds, themes, colorways, etc).
