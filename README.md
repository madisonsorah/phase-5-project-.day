.DAY is a digital journal designed with the minimalist in mind. When an author creates an account, they can choose from one of four template themes for daily habit tracking. Each journal entry is saved to an authorâ€™s .DAY profile and calendar grid for their reference, but is completely private and can only be viewed by them.
